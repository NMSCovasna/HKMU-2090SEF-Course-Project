<h1>Task 1</h1>  
User Guide (how to run Python code)
1. Download the original .py file called"calendarv5" on the main page
2. Use IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Pytharm) to open it
3. Select debugging mode
4. Directly running the program in IDEs


We are currently working on designing a portable student calendar program using OOP framework, which allows users to select dates and add to-do lists. The complete functionality is still under development and the code is not yet completed.

*WIP:GUI Interface*
Only used for verifying the save function: This module aims to deal with the problem that program delete all stored todo list parameters automatically after user closed the program.

<h2>Features</h2>

1."CalendarTodoApp" : Lightweight initialization calendar module
   ``` python
    class CalendarTodoApp(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title(APP_NAME)
        self.geometry("920x560")
        self.minsize(860, 500)

        self.store = TodoStore(DATA_FILE)

        today = date.today()
        self.current_year = today.year
        self.current_month = today.month
        self.selected_day = today

        self._build_ui()
        self._render_calendar()
        self._refresh_todo_list()
```
We used the most concise architecture possible to write the GUI. Self-calling fuctions have been used inside it.

2.Encapsulation & Composition in calendar data storing
``` python
class TodoStore:
    def __init__(self, file_path: Path):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.data: dict[str, list[TodoItem]] = {}
        self.ensure_data_dir()
        self.load()

    def ensure_data_dir(self):
        self.file_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    def load(self):
        if not self.file_path.exists():
            self.data = {}
            self.save()
            return
```

In order to prevent data from being easily lost when closing the program, we created "TodoStore" module and established a long-term storage module using instantiated objects and other methods.


<h2>What's Next</h2>  

<b>Advanced supporting methods</b> is still in planning status.
The current focus is on <b>establishing a timeline</b> in the future and designing a feature that can repeat multiple cycles, rather than displaying it all at once.


<h1>Task 2</h1>

We are currently choosing the <b>Binary tree</b> data structure and <b>Shell sort</b> algorithm program as our self-study topic, which acquire broader knowledge about algorithm development. The complete functionality is still under development and the code is not yet completed. 
<br>

<h2>A) Binary Tree Data Structure</h2>

Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most <b>2</b> children.

<h2>Ai) Properties</h2>

* Node: Each element in a binary tree. The topmost node is known as <b>Root Node</b> and node with no children classified as <b>Leaf Note</b>.
* Height: Length of the longest path between the root and leaf.
* Depth: Length of the path between root and note.
* Subtree: Any node along with its descendants.
<br>

<h2>B) Shell Sort Algorithm</h2>

Shell Sort is an extension of insertion sort that allows far apart items exchange. The main idea behind is to arrange the element lists. Thus, taking every ? element produres sorted lists starting anywhere.

With sequence of gaps or intervals, allows for more efficient sorting than simple insertion sort.

<h2>Bi) Key Concepts</h2>
* Gaps: The algorithm begins by dividing the list into sublists based on gap vaule and sorted using an insertion sort. <br>
* Gap Reduction: The gap reduced in each iteration until becomes <b>1</b>, which the final insertion sort is performed on nearly sorted array. <br>
* Performance: Efficiency of shell sort comes from elements pre-sorting with larger intervals, which brings elements closer to their final position. <br>
<br>

``` python
def shell_sort(arr):
    size = len(arr)
    gap = size // 2

    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, size):
            anchor = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j-gap] > anchor:
                arr[j] = arr[j-gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = anchor
        gap = gap // 2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    elements = [61, 9, 62, 83, 37, 80, 32, 45, 93]
    shell_sort(elements)
    print(elements)
```

<h2>Bii) Time Complexity Analysis</h2>
Can be analyzed depends on the <b>3</b> cases of gap sequence used. <br> 
1) Standard: n / 2, n / 4, ... , 1 or O(n?). <br>
2) Worst: O(n?) or O(nlog?n). <br>
3) Best: O(n) for a nearly sorted array. <br>
<br>

<h2>C) Possible Application</h2>
* Database Indexing <br>
* Memoery Management <br>
* Game Development <br>
