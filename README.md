<h1>Task 1</h1>  


<h2>User Guide (how to run Python code)</h2>

1. Download the original .py file called "calendarv5" on the main page
2. Use IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Pycharm) to open it
3. Click "View" and Select debugging mode (shortcut:F5)
4. Directly running the program in IDEs

*GUI Interface*

Completed GUI demonstration: Compared to the development version, it adds import/export functionality, dark mode switching functionality, toggle functionality, some minor features, and a more concise and organized main interface.

*WIP GUI Interface In March*

<h2>Features</h2>

1."CalendarTodoApp" : Lightweight initialization calendar module
   ``` python
    class CalendarTodoApp(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title(APP_NAME)
        self.geometry("920x560")
        self.minsize(860, 500)

        self.store = TodoStore(DATA_FILE)

        today = date.today()
        self.current_year = today.year
        self.current_month = today.month
        self.selected_day = today

        self._build_ui()
        self._render_calendar()
        self._refresh_todo_list()
```
We used the most concise architecture possible to write the GUI. Self-calling fuctions have been used inside it.

2.Encapsulation & Composition in calendar data storing
``` python
class TodoStore:
    def __init__(self, file_path: Path):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.data: dict[str, list[TodoItem]] = {}
        self.ensure_data_dir()
        self.load()

    def ensure_data_dir(self):
        self.file_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    def load(self):
        if not self.file_path.exists():
            self.data = {}
            self.save()
            return
```

In order to prevent data from being easily lost when closing the program, we created "TodoStore" module and established a long-term storage module using instantiated objects and other methods.


<h2>What's Next</h2>  

<b>Advanced supporting methods</b> may use in future development.

In future development we have planned to design a feature that can repeat <b>multiple cycles</b>, rather than displaying it all at once.

<h2>A) Binary Tree Data Structure</h2>

A non-linear and hierarchincal conceptual model where every node has at most two children. Also, each node is build-up by three components: Data, left and right child pointers.

<h2>User Guide (how to run Python code)</h2>

Question: How to use Binary tree data structure to create a binary tree of the below picture? 

![image alt](https://github.com/keithchan527-glitch/COMP2090SEF-Course-Project/blob/main/WhatsApp%20Image%202026-04-17%20at%209.27.56%20AM.jpeg?raw=true)

Pricinple: Ensure each node has at most two children.

Step 1: Define the node structure with contain data (value) by create "class".

Step 2: Establish the first node as "root" and linking subsequent nodes hierachically with both left and right child pointer. 

        -> Setting both left and right pointers to "None" initially.

* Note: In standard Binary Search Tree (BST), the value of left-child node must be smaller than its parent node.

        -> Ensure the value of node must be: Left-child < Parent < Right child.

``` python
Class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data 
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        
root = Node(15)
secondNode = Node(35)
thirdNode = Node(40)
fourthNode = Node(3)
FifthNode = Node(6)
SixthNode = Node(5)
SeventhNode = Node(7)
EigthNode = Node(1)
NinthNode = Node(10)
TenthNode = Node(8)
EleventhNode = Node(41)

root.left = secondNode
root.right = thirdNode
root.left.left = fourthNode 
root.left.right = FifthNode
root.right.left = SixthNode
root.right.right = SeventhNode
root.left.left.left = EigthNode
root.left.left.right = NinthNode
root.right.left.left = TenthNode
root.right.left.right = EleventhNode
```

<h2>B) Shell Sort Algorithm</h2>

An in-place comparison sort which allows elements exchange in datasets by comparing through larger distances in initial stages, and reduce gap size and required swaps times to catalytic the process. 

<h2>User Guide (how to run Python code)</h2>

Question: How to sort out the list [61, 9, 62, 83, 37, 80, 32, 45, 93] by using Shell sort algorithm?

Step 1: Choose a suitable gap sequence in initial stages, like (n/2 or n/4) in common. 

        -> Divide the list into several subarrays.
        
        -> Time complexity depends on gap sequence chosen uniquely.

Step 2: Elments would sort in each subarrays by using insertion sort.

Step 3: The gap subside until becomes 1 after operate the process repeatedly like the code below. 

``` python
def shell_sort(arr):
    size = len(arr)
    gap = size // 2

    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, size):
            anchor = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j-gap] > anchor:
                arr[j] = arr[j-gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = anchor
        gap = gap // 2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    list = [61, 9, 62, 83, 37, 80, 32, 45, 93]
    shell_sort(list)
    print(list)
```

Hence, it would sort out the list [61, 9, 62, 83, 37, 80, 32, 45, 93] by using Shell sort algorithm and results as:

``` python
[9, 32, 37, 45, 61, 62, 80, 83, 93]
```
