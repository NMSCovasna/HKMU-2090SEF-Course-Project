Task1&amp;Task2

This Project is maily use for the 2090SEF course project(Preliminary code submission).

<h1>Task 1</h1>  

We are currently working on designing a portable student calendar program using OOP framework, which allows users to select dates and add to-do lists. The complete functionality is still under development and the code is not yet completed.

*WIP:GUI Interface*
Only used for verifying the save function: This module aims to deal with the problem that program delete all stored todo list parameters automatically after user closed the program.

<h1>Features</h1>

   ``` python
    class CalendarTodoApp(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.title(APP_NAME)
        self.geometry("920x560")
        self.minsize(860, 500)

        self.store = TodoStore(DATA_FILE)

        today = date.today()
        self.current_year = today.year
        self.current_month = today.month
        self.selected_day = today

        self._build_ui()
        self._render_calendar()
        self._refresh_todo_list()
    
    We used the most concise architecture possible to write the GUI. Self-calling fuctions have been used inside it.


<h1>What's Next</h1>  

<b>Advanced supporting methods</b> is still in planning status.
